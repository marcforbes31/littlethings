                    I remember this day from start to finish, I think. Now I'm no poet nor wordmaster or anything, so bear with me here.<br>
               </p>

               <h1 class="font-msz">Chapter 1 : The Beginning</h1><br>

                So it all started silent at first, in complete darkness I took in every breath and exhaled. Creeping in the distance
                was a rather cumbersome sound fading in stronger by the second. As time continued to progress, the sound was too strong for me to bear any longer.
                Then, in a split second the total darkness which coated my entire vision went away. My eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling while that noise still lingers around.
                I later discovered the source of the piercing sound which was coming from my right, shooting out of my phone speakers. I quickly shut off my alarm and got out of bed.
                It was around half past eight in the morning, where I was gazing into the mirror accompanied by a wide smile on my face, along with
                little tingles inside my belly. "Today is the day", I said to myself as I let the bristles of my toothbrush glide across my teeth.

               <h1 class="font-msz">Chapter 2 : The Car</h1><br>
               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                The day was just about to begin its real journey. When ten in the morning came around, the guy from Trevo gave me a call and uttered
                exactly what I wanted to hear, "The car is here." . I mean, well, he didn't exactly say that, I'm paraphrasing of course. Okay anyways,
                This paragraph won't be as fancy as the first one hehe, was just trying to flex a little, but oh well I've got nothing left in the tank for that.
                This is coming straight from the heart, Baobei. After finally getting my hands on the car and test driving a little, I quickly went back up and took my things.
                Now, the real journey... BEGINS!

               </p>

               <h1 class="font-msz">Chapter 3 : Gift Shopping</h1><br>
               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                Well would you look at that, it's Valentine's, so of course I thought it would be appropriate to get you some things. But oh no,
                time is running out, I have around 90 minutes TOPS to get you flowers AND reach the airport in time. Time is ticking, the suspense is
                building. Will I succeed in this quest? 

               </p>

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                After a quick stop at the gas station, I went straight to the only florist around I knew. Oh no! No tulips, nor do they have anything
                I could have afforded. Besides, they told me that most items have already been booked. Of course, this made me panic a little. I kept
                looking at my watch from time to time to figure out how much time I have left (Not much). I stopped to think about what or where else I could go,
                at this early hour. Oh right! ITCC should have something. Thus, onto ITCC!
               </p>

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                When I got there, time was not on my side so I started quick. Getting the chocolates was the easy part. Next part, flowers.
                Now that was not so easy. I started looking for tulips at first, but damn it seemed everybody was only selling roses. 
                I don't blame them though, Valentines, right? So I told myself, sod it, roses will do for now (I'll get you tulips another time).
                I circle around ITCC a few times until I realized "Oh wait, there are booths here" . So long story short, I got you 1 rose. 
                It is not much, but I will for sure do better next time. Now, with that done, time to get you at the airport!   

               </p>

               <h1 class="font-msz">Chapter 4 : Reunited</h1><br>
               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                After driving several minutes, I was finally there. The plane-shaped building upon me. I parked the car and took a quick look at my wrist,
                with my watch indicating that I was indeed on time. My heart was pounding, head was a little light, almost as if I was on some kind of drug.
                There I was, standing right outside the arrival gate, looking at, as well as over every face and silhouette, trying to pick out my woman.
                Nothing has changed in that moment, heart still racing, head like a feather. Several anxious minutes went on and there you were, as beautiful, majestic, and graceful as
                ever.

               </p>

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                Now I have had butterflies already, but when our eyes met, it was as if those butterflies just had a massive breeding spree in my tummy.
                Seeing you after so long just brought a different kind of joy, a unique one, the kind of joy where only I feel when you are around.
                My mind could not conjure up many words, nor can it even try to clear out any awkwardness. Instead, I chose only to embrace that small window
                of awkwardness. We then continued the journey, only difference was that we were finally continuing it, together.

                 I'd say you were quite happy to receive the flowers and chocolates, which made me a little happy. Alright moving on, we chose
                 Sin Wan as our next destination. And boy was that a good choice. After so long, both of us once again enjoyed good Tom Yam. Definitely
                 questionable noodle choice from you as always, but it was really nice to have a good meal again together.

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                Well, we both know we were supposed to go to Imago. But oh well, that didn't go to plan. But we always have our trusty alternative,
                McDonald's and night drives. So, after getting good food and spent some quality time, we needed a way to sign off for the day. Ah well,
                we settled on The Last Of Us. It was a good meal and watched I think 1 episode. Oh and how can I forget? You gave me gifts too! I love them
                all! From the t-shirts to the cap, to even the sunblock. I love each and every one of them. Thank you for getting me gifts. 
                Well it's safe to say that was the end of the first day,
                we said goodnight and looked forward to the next day.

                       I hope you liked and enjoyed the little puzzle earlier. I was working on it all day long. Alrighty, let's begin!
                       Happy 23rd Birthday Baobei. Now you might be wondering why the layout is similar to that of the previous letter.
                       Well, hehe I thought it looked good so I am using it once more, after all, the words I write here are arguably way
                       more important than the layout, right?....Right? 
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-2 mt-5">
                       I've always felt like there was a very veeeerry thin line between birthday wishes and anniversary wishes, but there is a line indeed,
                       and I always try my best to not cross the line and mix the two. However, if you're smart enough like me, you can find the grey area 
                       and utilize it to its full potential. Like for example, I am such a lucky guy to have such a beautiful, smart, charismatic, and joyful
                       girlfriend who I can wish and also celebrate her birthday, hehe.
                     </p>

                    <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-2 mt-5">
                       This birthday feels a little more special, I mean if you could put aside the fact that we're not celebrating it together.
                       The reason why I say it's special is because you finally get to celebrate it with your family. Today is your day! You should
                       enjoy it how you wish, me lov. Since you're home, you could bake with your mom, and overall spend time with your loved ones! 
                     </p>

                     <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-2 mt-5">
                        To say my birthday wish for you last year was underwhelming is an absolute OVERSTATEMENT. God, if I could turn back time, I'd
                        definitely do it differently than that. But, since I am not a time traveler, the best I can do is do better! And I hope this is better.
                        This is your 5th birthday with me, and I am always glad and grateful to have you with me and I wish to celebrate many many more of your birthdays.
                      </p>

                      <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-2 mt-5">
                        I wish nothing but the best for you, not just because its your birthday (I'm just emphasizing this BECAUSE its your birthday, hehe)
                        This year, I have no extravagant gifts to give you but I will always try my best to do better on the next one! For sure! Oh but remember that
                        bag I got for you? Yeah, it might be arriving way sooner than you think. At least you can look forward to that one. I will try my best
                        to get my hands on the bag as soon as possible.
                      </p>

                      <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-2 mt-5">
                        I guess that concludes my birthday wish for you, Dear Jasmine. I truly wish and hope that you get to fully enjoy your day. I love you
                        from head to toe, from the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean, and from the bottom of my cholestrol filled heart. I would give you a 
                        hug for sure, but last I checked, Penampang is around 225km away from Sandakan so we have to put that on hold for now. Tata for now, beautiful.

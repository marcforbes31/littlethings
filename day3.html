               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                So we once again kicked things off with Dim Sum. Yes, again. Because you couldn't help yourself can you, Tamin? One meal the day 
                before wasn't enough apparently. Being the very good boyfriend I am, of course I said "Yeah sure why not?". The story from here
                is similar to the Suria chapter from Day 2, so no need to rinse and repeat. As expected, the food was delicious and fulfilling. 
                It was a very good start to the day, we were going strong and it looked like it was on course to be that way throughout.

                But oh well, it couldn't be that easy now could it? In every movie there has to be a drop point, a CONFLICT, and this was ours. It all started
                when I wanted to go to Tinyrobot. Well we both know what happened then, right? After Suria, we finally went to Imago but the only 
                problem was, we brought the fight with us as well. We spent so much time not talking to each other and stayed very distant from one another,
                which I do fully regret. I didn't take any pictures during our fight but I still remember how mad you were. Let me find something to represent 
                you when you were angry on that day hehe.

                I think I got that spot on. But in all seriousness, I really hate it when we fight. But fights are normal, we just need to
                find and commit to an effective way of solving them. Fortunately for the both of us, around half past nine at night, we managed
                to finally forgive each other. It was a beautiful moment, and it was very heartwarming, I must say. We hugged it out and became
                the best of friends again yay! "Oh, now that we're back on each other's good side, that means we still have time left to catch 
                our movie!". Yeah that's right!

                It should be considered a tradition at this point. If we see each other, we most certainly will catch a movie together
                (If there are any good ones available that is) and lucky for us, a Marvel movie just released. Well why not? Looked promising anyways.
                We booked the tickets the day before and we only stopped by the counter to buy some overpriced snacks. I mean I guess RM20 for 
                medium popcorn and soda is alright but the rates they charged for that corn and the sausages were just insane. And the worst part is,
                they weren't even anywhere close to being decent tasting. But hey, food is food so here's some shots of us!

                Meh - is what I'd give Ant-Man. Marvel has been putting out really mediocre movies lately and this one was no exception.
                However, it was still enjoyable so I was pretty satisfied. We held hands while you leaned on my shoulder, which I really liked.
                I gave you the hoodie for you to wear but you just covered your legs. Guess you wanted to flex how you could stand the cold, huh.
                Oh, and that popcorn and coke did nothing good to my throat, just made it way itchier and made me cough more but hey, what's gonna

                I said Ant-Man was mediocre entertainment, but do you know what was NOT mediocre entertainment? Manchester United. They were on fire, even
                to this day actually. I found it quite cute that you stayed up and watched the game with me for a little bit. Mid-way through the game I decided
                to cook up those Maggi Hot Cups that we bought the day before, and I knew you were looking forward to that more than the football game. I opened 
                and cooked one Maggi Kari Hot Cup and you practically ate it all. So I cooked the other one and you tried to eat all of that too, but 
                luckily you hated the texture of the noodles, hehe but actually maybe you should have eaten them because them noodles made my throat even worse.
                A few minutes later you were sound asleep, as I watched the game. The sight of you 
                sleeping comfortably just makes me feel at ease, because you're not awake to bother me. IM KIDDING, IM KIDDING. But in all seriousness,
                it just makes me feel warm, like you're safe here with me and I will look after you.

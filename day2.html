               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                Here we are, day two of this short little vacation. We had the whole day to ourselves and we did not have to worry about 
                anything. So, the main focus of day two was mainly quality time, right? Now maybe the pages from here on out won't be as long
                as Day 1's , but I assure you that does not matter at all. Right! Let's get things going, shall we?

               </p>

               <h1 class="font-msz">Chapter 2 : Luyang</h1><br>
               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                What better way was there to start the day, right love? I mean, granted it wasn't that early (I think it was around noon), but anyways..
                As I was saying, what better way to start the day than starting it with Dim Sum. To be more specific, Wong Kwok Dim Sum. Ah, the juiciness and 
                overall sheer quality of those Dim Sums, just made it a no-brainer for us. So, we began our journey to Luyang, filled with excitement and
                high hopes. Unfortunately, when we got there, the Luyang WK Restaurant was under renovation. Oh bummer. We thought it was all over by then..
                But oh wait, they have another branch in Suria! We looked at each other and immediately knew where we're headed next. 

               </p>

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                The drive from Luyang to Suria felt instantaneous because when I'm with you I just don't realize how much time has passed (Cheesy Points + 1).
                Alrighty, when we got to Suria, the first stop was.. You guessed it. Drum roll please... Wong Kwok! There's something special about going on
                Dim Sum dates with you, Baobei. 

               </p>

                    the yam thingy, ALL of them! Oh and the soup too! The corn soup was delicious but that fish maw soup was something else wasn't it, love?
                    Especially when you add that chinese black vinegar too it.

                enjoyed our time together, especially during meals because you talked plenty. And I really really really REAAALLY enjoyed hearing them.
                Now, I have some form of media here at my disposal. So I will be putting them here, hehe. Enjoy!

                After Dim Sum, we took a walk around Suria to spend some quality time together. It was nice. After all, gotta get those
                steps in, right? Hehe. Can't really recall what else we bought after Dim Sum, maybe we did get some snacks or dessert but
                meh, oh well. We move onto the next chapter! Oh wait, you got that mango drink from Boost, now I remember. I, on the other hand, was 
                quite disappointed with myself, for putting too high expectations on Chagee, which ultimately let me down huhu.

               <h1 class="font-msz">Chapter 4 : The Beach</h1><br>
               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                Our time at Suria was lovely wasn't it? But we still had the rest of the evening to look forward to! And what better way to spend
                evenings than the beach? So, that was exactly where we went. The idea of bringing you to the beach had been on my mind for several 
                weeks already. Right, so we get to the beach, parked out waaaaaaaay back there, and took a lovely stroll together along the shore.
                It was just a few minutes before the sun went down, but we managed to walk quite a bit. The breeze, the smell of the ocean, and the
                happy environment is always nice to see and experience, especially with you. We had some very meaningful talks during our walk, which again,
                I truly appreciate and enjoy.

               </p>

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                By the time we began our journey back to the car, it was already dark. The sun has gone to light up the other side of the world while we
                try our best to make it to the car without any casualties. There is a silver lining though. The dim lights from the restaurants and cafes
                on the side of the beach slightly lit our path, making it somewhat romantic. At this point the sound of the waves become more apparent. I honestly
                enjoyed our walk back more since it was calmer and a tad bit more relaxing. Once we got to the car, the next destination was to the beach side
                stalls for some food.

               </p>

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                You know it really does seem like this whole day was just us getting food basically. Which is awesome! Once we got to the beach side stalls,
                it became very clear to me that THAT place was HOT (Temperature-wise). But the place was lively, and the food choices were in an abundance.
                We got your favorite ayam panggang, and I bought pisang cheese (Which you did not eat that much smh). Ah, and not to forget the bakso as well.
                I mean RM8 for one bakso is, expensive but I guess the flavors were on point so hey, not complaining. You got your mango drink (Yes, another one)
                but that drink was amazing! The mango flavor was really potent and they gave you some big chunks of mangoes in there too.

               </p>

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                So we got our food and got out of there. We ended the night beautifully, by eating the food we bought, while watching, yes 
                you guessed it, The Last Of Us. Overall, I enjoyed and cherish this day very much. It was very wholesome, and I really look
                forward to more days like this one.

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                This day was probably the earliest we have gotten up and running, apart from the first day. Also, this page will most likely
                be the shortest among all other pages, because we only had a few hours together before you flew back home. We started off this
                day with one of your most favorite places to eat, Jia Siang. I remember on the day, my throat was absolutely KILLING me. When we
                reached Jia Siang you ordered your favorite, Kon Lau Mee with only lean meat and meatballs, while I on the other hand opted for a 
                safer option, Kuey Teow Soup. Oh yes, also those stuffed meatballs, very yummy. This was also the day you got me medicine, which 
                I found very cute and wholesome. Thank you for the medicine baobei, I'm feeling much much better if you're wondering hihi.

               </p>

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                That was our savory breakfast done. The next part should also be considered tradition. What's the next part you ask? If it isn't 
                already obvious, I'm talking about Yoyo. I dropped you off at Yoyo and I believe you bought your favorite, tiny pearl milk tea. I
                do not recall you buying those cream puffs though, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if you actually got them.  

               </p>

               <h1 class="font-msz">Chapter 2 : Airport</h1><br>
               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                Right, Jia Siang, DONE. Yoyo, DONE. What was left to do in that moment? Send you to the airport, huhu. Like I said earlier,
                time passes by so quickly when I'm with you so it was no surprise that I felt as if time was passing by at an insanely rate
                in that moment. I took in every little moment I had with you, enjoying every minute and every second of the drive to the airport.


               </p>

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
                So there we were, at the airport, we actually reached their significantly earlier than we should have, I think. The good thing
                was that we didn't need to go through all that hassle waiting in line to check in your luggage, a very big plus indeed. After the
                luggage drop off, we just headed down right outside the security check area, and just chilled and talk for the remainder of our time.

               <p class="text-indent font-mynerve fs-4">
               A few minutes later, it was time. Time for you, my tamin, to go home. On one hand, I was feeling quite sad, because we would have to be
               away from each other again, and the feeling of you leaving my side will never ever not hurt. But on the other hand, I also felt quite 
               happy because you were finally going home, to be with your family. After all, family is more important. We hugged for the last time that day
               and I kissed your forehead like I always do before you go. I watched as you went through airport security and walked to your gate. You 
               turned around a few times to wave goodbye, and I was still there. I waited all the way. An hour or so later, Jasmine was home, at last.
